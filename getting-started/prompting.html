                    <h2>Getting Started with AI Prompting</h2>
                    <p>Forget about complex prompt engineering guides. Instead, let's focus on a simple, practical approach that works for educators in real classroom situations.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="examples-container">
                    <p>When you're just beginning with AI tools, it's easy to get caught up in the "right way" to ask questions. You might worry about using perfect phrasing or finding the exact keywords.</p>
                    <p>But here's the good news: you don't need to overthink it. The most effective approach is much simpler and follows a natural conversational pattern. In this module, we'll introduce you to a straightforward framework that makes AI prompting accessible to everyone, regardless of technical background.</p>

                    <h2>A Simple Framework for Effective Prompting</h2>
                    <p>Our approach breaks down effective AI prompting into three simple steps:</p>

                                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Write naturally as if chatting with a colleague. Typos and incomplete sentences are fine—focus on your ideas, not perfect language.

                    <p>Think about something you actually need for your classroom—perhaps a resource you've been meaning to create or an activity you'd like to try. Real needs lead to more meaningful practice.</p>

                    <p>Before you start, collect any relevant curriculum documents, specifications, textbook pages, or existing resources that could provide helpful context. Remember that you can upload these directly to most AI tools.</p>
                    
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;"><i class="fas fa-sync-alt" style="color: var(--tertiary); margin-right: 10px;"></i>Embrace the Conversation</h3>
                    <p>Don't expect perfection on the first try. Be prepared to provide feedback, ask for revisions, and guide the AI toward what you need. The more you practice this conversational approach, the more effective your prompting will become.</p>

                        <p>The goal isn't perfect prompting—it's getting useful results that save you time and enhance your teaching. Don't overthink it. Express your needs, provide context, and refine through conversation.</p>

                            <p>Absolutely! AI can help generate lesson plans, curriculum maps, and long-term planning documents. Be sure to include details about your curriculum framework, assessment requirements, and school context. For best results, upload actual specification documents or syllabus materials directly to the AI. This provides the precise language and requirements needed for accurate planning. Remember to review and adapt the AI's suggestions to fit your specific teaching style and student needs.</p>

                            <p>Most modern AI tools allow you to upload a variety of files to provide richer context. These typically include PDFs, Word documents, images, PowerPoint presentations, Excel files, and text files. You can upload specification documents, textbook pages, student work samples (anonymized), lesson plan templates, or school policies to help the AI understand your specific context. The AI can analyze these files and use them as reference points when generating content for you.</p>
