Create a set of differentiated learning tasks for Year [X] [SUBJECT] on [TOPIC] that allows all students to access the same key learning but with appropriate levels of challenge.

Design three clearly differentiated tiers:
1. Foundation tier - For students working below age-related expectations  
2. Core tier - For students working at age-related expectations  
3. Extension tier - For students working above age-related expectations

Each tier should:
- Focus on the same key learning objectives aligned with [CURRICULUM/EXAM BOARD]  
- Provide an appropriate level of support/challenge  
- Include clear success criteria specific to that tier  
- Build student confidence while maintaining high expectations

For each tier, provide:
- A complete set of student instructions and tasks  
- Any necessary resources or templates  
- Assessment criteria specific to that tier  
- Common misconceptions to watch for at this level  
- Guidance on how to support students at this level

Also include a system for:
- How students should be assigned to tiers  
- How to manage the different groups during the lesson  
- How students can self-select appropriate challenge  
- How to enable progression between tiers

Format this as a complete teaching resource pack ready for classroom use. Use British English spelling and terminology throughout.

Create a comprehensive scaffolding framework for teaching [TOPIC] to Year [X] [SUBJECT] students with diverse learning needs, following [CURRICULUM/EXAM BOARD] requirements.

Design a progressive scaffolding system that:
1. Starts with maximum support for initial learning  
2. Gradually removes scaffolding as students develop competence  
3. Eventually leads to independent application of skills/knowledge

Include the following scaffolding elements, with examples for each stage of learning:

1. Cognitive scaffolds:
   - Thinking frameworks and graphic organisers  
   - Worked examples with explanations  
   - Partial examples requiring completion  
   - Self-questioning prompts  
   - Analogies and connections to prior knowledge

2. Procedural scaffolds:
   - Step-by-step guides  
   - Checklists and success criteria  
   - Process maps or flowcharts  
   - Models of excellence with annotations

3. Metacognitive scaffolds:
   - Self-monitoring tools  
   - Reflection questions and prompts  
   - Error analysis frameworks  
   - Strategy selection guides

4. Conceptual scaffolds:
   - Key concept explanations at different levels  
   - Visual representations of abstract ideas  
   - Concrete to abstract learning progression  
   - Connections between concepts

For each type of scaffold, provide:
- The specific learning phase where it's most useful  
- Implementation guidance for teachers  
- Criteria for when to remove or reduce the scaffold  
- Alternative approaches for different learning preferences

The framework should be structured to gradually transfer responsibility from teacher to student. Use British English spelling and terminology throughout.

1. Visual learning approaches:
   - Infographics or visual summaries (described in detail)  
   - Mind maps or concept maps  
   - Visual timelines or process diagrams  
   - Colour-coding systems for categorisation

2. Auditory learning approaches:
   - Discussion frameworks and questions  
   - Verbal explanation scripts with analogies  
   - Mnemonic devices and verbal patterns  
   - Debate or discussion formats

3. Kinesthetic/tactile learning approaches:
   - Hands-on activities or demonstrations  
   - Movement-based learning sequences  
   - Manipulative resources (described)  
   - Role play or simulation activities

4. Reading/writing approaches:

Create a comprehensive extension pack for highly able/gifted Year [X] [SUBJECT] students who have mastered the core curriculum content on [TOPIC]. This should extend their learning horizontally (breadth) rather than simply accelerating to the next year's content.

The extension pack should include:

1. Depth extension activities that:
   - Develop higher-order thinking skills (analysis, evaluation, synthesis)  
   - Explore underlying principles and concepts  
   - Examine alternative perspectives or interpretations  
   - Encourage critical evaluation of the content  
   - Promote metacognitive awareness and reflection

2. Complexity extension activities that:
   - Introduce interdisciplinary connections  
   - Present multi-step problems requiring strategic thinking  
   - Incorporate ambiguity and multiple variables  
   - Challenge students to devise their own solutions  
   - Involve systems thinking and complex relationships

3. Creative application activities that:
   - Encourage innovative problem-solving  
   - Allow for multiple correct approaches  
   - Provide opportunities for student-led inquiry  
   - Require adaptation of knowledge to novel situations  
   - Result in original student products or ideas

Also include:
- Assessment criteria that recognise sophisticated understanding  
- Guidance for teachers on facilitating rather than directing  
- Self-assessment tools for students  
- Links to advanced resources and references  
- Suggestions for authentic audiences for student work

The pack should maintain connection to the core curriculum while offering significant additional challenge. Use British English spelling and terminology throughout.
